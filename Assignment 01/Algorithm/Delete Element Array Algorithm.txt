			Algorithm (Delete Element from Array)

Input:- The array size, list of elements along with the element to look for and delete.
Output:- If the target element has been found, show how many times it got deleted. Else indicate that the search was unsuccessful. In both cases, print the array.
Data Structure:- One Dimensional Array

Steps:-
1: Start
2: Print "Enter the size"
3: Read size
4: If size < 1 then
	4.1: Print "Invalid size."
	4.2: Stop
5: EndIf
6: For i=0 to size-1 do // i is the loop counter
	6.1: Read arr[i]
7: EndFor
8: Print "Which element to delete?"
9: Read target
10: count ← 0 // count tracks how many times deletion has been performed
11: For i=0 to size-1 do
	11.1: If arr[i] = target then
		11.1.1: For j=i to less than size-1 do
			11.1.1.1: arr[j] ← arr[j+1]
		11.1.2: EndFor
		11.1.3: count ← count + 1 // deletion performed +1 times
	11.2: EndIf
12: EndFor
13: If count > 0 then
	13.1: Print target, "found", count, "times in the array and successfully deleted. Modified array is below:"
14: Else
	14.1: Print target, "not found in the array and thus can not be deleted."
15: EndIf
16: For i=0 to size-1-count do
	16.1: Print arr[i]
17: EndFor
18: Stop
